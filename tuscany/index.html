    <p style="color:red;">Note to professor: I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I couldn't even open the sample images on my home computer. I tried using multiple different programs and even removed the ._ from the beginnings of their names with no luck. I hope the alt text will suffice, or else you'll be able to guide me through my mistake.</p>
    
    <h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
    <p>I went to Italy. Click the pictures to see the same pictures, but bigger.</p>
    
    <h2>A Massive Cathedral</h2>
    <br><p><a href="cathedral.html" target="_blank"><img src="thumbnails/._cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="an absolutely bonkers big church" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
    <p>This is a big ol church I saw with my very own two eyes. I wonder if Jesus lives there.</p>
    
    <h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
    <p><a href="countryside.html" target="_blank"><img src="thumbnails/._countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="A delicious pigmy hill with grass a la mode" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
    <p>The verdant, golden hills seemed to stretch on infinitely. I knew they didn't, of course, seeing as the earth is flat. it was fun to imagine, though.</p>
    
    <h2>Flowering Lavender</h2>
    <p><a href="lavender.html" target="_blank"><img src="thumbnails/._lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="Lavender Breeze take me away" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
    <p>Lavender is my absolute favorite flower. It's a beautiful color and it has a nice, subtle smell that grows more potent the closer you sniff. It's like the gamer girl feet of the flower world.</p>
    
    <h2>The Street of Sienna</h2>
    <p><a href="sienna.html" target="_blank"><img src="thumbnails/._sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="A street." width="75" height="100"></a></p>
    <p>Navigating the streets of Sienna was difficult on account of the beauty causing me to be fully tumescent for the entirety of my trip. I had to hobble carefully in order to avoid blocking off entire streets.</p>
    
    <h2>Sweets</h2>
    <p><a href="sweets.html" target="_blank"><img src="thumbnails/._sweets_thumb.jpg" alt="Teeth-rotting candy" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
    <p>Normally I don't let myself have sweets, but what the heck! I'm on vacation, right? Oooh I'm so baaaad! :3</p>
    
    <h2>Out My Window</h2>
    <p><a href="window.html" target="_blank"><img src="thumbnails/._window_thumb.jpg" alt="A fenestrated hillscape" width="75" height="100"></a></p>
    <p>I couldn't figure out how to turn the windows off, so I learned to enjoy this view for the greater part of my stay.</p>
