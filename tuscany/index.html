    <h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
    <p>I went to Italy. Click the pictures to see the same pictures, but bigger.</p>
    
    <h2>A Massive Cathedral</h2>
    <p><a href="cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="an absolutely bonkers big church" width="100" height="75"></a> This is a big ol church I saw with my very own two eyes. I wonder if Jesus lives there.</p>
    
    <h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
    <p><a href="countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="A delicious pigmy hill with grass a la mode" width="100" height="75"></a> The verdant, golden hills seemed to stretch on infinitely. I knew they didn't, of course, seeing as the earth is flat. it was fun to imagine, though.</p>
    
    <h2>Flowering Lavender</h2>
    <p><a href="lavender.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="Lavender Breeze take me away" width="100" height="75"></a> Lavender is my absolute favorite flower. It's a beautiful color and it has a nice, subtle smell that grows more potent the closer you sniff. It's like the gamer girl feet of the flower world.</p>
    
    <h2>The Street of Sienna</h2>
    <p><a href="sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="A street." width="75" height="100"></a> Navigating the streets of Sienna was difficult on account of the beauty causing me to be fully tumescent for the entirety of my trip. I had to hobble carefully in order to avoid blocking off entire streets.</p>
    
    <h2>Sweets</h2>
    <p><a href="sweets.html"><img src="thumbnails/sweets_thumb.jpg" alt="Teeth-rotting candy" width="100" height="75"></a> Normally I don't let myself have sweets, but what the heck! I'm on vacation, right? Oooh I'm so baaaad! :3</p>
    
    <h2>Out My Window</h2>
    <p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="A fenestrated hillscape" width="75" height="100"></a> I couldn't figure out how to turn the windows off, so I learned to enjoy this view for the greater part of my stay.</p>
